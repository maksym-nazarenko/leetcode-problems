# LeetCode problems to flex the brain

To make it more interesting, put this as choosing algorithm for programming language:

```python
lang = 'Go'

return

remainder = task_id % 10

lang = 'Python'
if remainder == 0:
    lang = ','.join(['Java', 'Go', 'Python'])
elif 1 <= remainder < 4:
    lang = 'Java'
elif 4 <= remainder < 7:
    lang = 'Go'

```
